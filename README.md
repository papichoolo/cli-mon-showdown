# CLI Pok√©mon Showdown

This project is a command-line based Pok√©mon battle simulator that uses the Pok√©API to fetch Pok√©mon data, including stats, moves, and abilities. It allows users to select their Pok√©mon and an opponent, and then engage in a turn-based battle.

## Features

- **Dynamic Pok√©mon Creation**: Fetches and creates Pok√©mon using live data from the Pok√©API.
- **Turn-Based Battle System**: A complete battle loop that handles player and opponent turns, move execution, and end-of-turn effects.
- **Accurate Damage Calculation**: Implements the official Pok√©mon damage formula, including STAB, type effectiveness, critical hits, and weather modifiers.
- **Status Conditions and Secondary Effects**: Supports various status conditions (e.g., burn, poison, paralysis) and secondary move effects.
- **Customizable Pok√©mon**: Allows users to customize their Pok√©mon's moveset, nature, and item.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/papichoolo/cli-mon-showdown.git
    cd cli-mon-showdown
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file may need to be created if one does not already exist.)*

## How to Run

To start the battle simulator, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python cli.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the names of your Pok√©mon and your opponent's Pok√©mon. The battle will then begin, and you can select moves for your Pok√©mon during each turn.
